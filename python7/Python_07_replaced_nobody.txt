everybody loves me,
everybody cares,
everybody picks me peaches and pears.
everybody offers me candy and Cokes,
everybody listens and laughs at me jokes.
everybody helps when I get in a fight,
everybody does all my homework at night.
everybody misses me,
everybody cries,
everybody thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that everybody is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and everybody just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for everybody's hand,
In the darkness where everybody usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
everybody's gone!
